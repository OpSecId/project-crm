## Cost Benefit Modeling Template

The spreadsheet template below provides a very simple tool to assist with the first-pass estimate of CRMTP implementation costs and benefits for individual businesses. It allows the user to choose how to weight each benefit category to suit their own circumstances. It also allows users to model break-even point with different assumptions about uptake rate across trading partners.

**Spreadsheet model TBD**
