An explanation of testing services can be found in the “Testing Services” section of the [UNTP site](https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/tools-and-support/TestService). The tools and guidance for their use can be accessed [here](https://github.com/uncefact/tests-untp).

Test implementations assist individual implementers and communities of implementers to test your conformance with UNTP-CRM, prior to broad adoption. 
These tools allow early implementers to manually create trial digital credentials, and publish them so they can be accessed by other pilot implementers, such as trading partners, customs authorities, and investors. You can find other planned implementers here, with whom you can test your test implementation.
