## Lithium Value Chain

The lithium value chain shown below indicates which role(s) are expected to **issue** which CRMTP credential types. 

diagram goes here

Any actor that has an identifier of a lithium  product, minsite, or refinery can find the issued credentials and verify them.  In general, downstream actors will be verifiers of upstream credentials. 

## Implementation Guidance

Each implementer role should follow links to the relevant credential specifications and ensure that they are issuing credentials according to the relevant specification. In most cases the technical implementation will be done by underlying [software](../register/Software) systems. However it is still important that each actor confirm that the CRMTP credentials issued by their chosen systems are valid by dropping them into the [conformity testing](Testing) service.
