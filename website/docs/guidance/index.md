This section of the UNTP-CRM project website describes **how** interested parties can undertake an UNTP-CRM implementation. At this stage of the project, in which UNTP-CRM is still being developed, implementers will be testing draft deliverables and providing feedback to the Project Team. Testing and feedback will enable refinement of deliverables for usability and practicality, and facilitate global scalability, which are principles of the project.
